I've made this repository to showcase my work, capabilites, and orginizational skills!
My name is William Frandsen! I was born on january 22nd, 1994 in Washington, Utah to Carl and Amy Frandsen and 9:26 A.M. I was raised in Cedar City, Utah. I have 3 children, and the motivation to provide them the life they deserve is the reason I chose to come back to school. My end goal, is to create a life where i enjoy my job, and can provide a life that my family deserves without breaking my body down to do it!
